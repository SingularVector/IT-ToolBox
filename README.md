PowerShell utilities for enterprise automation, secure logging, identity validation,
and cross-platform operational tooling.

IT-ToolBox is a practical PowerShell module for real-world admin and infrastructure
workflows. It is designed for teams that want explicit validation, secure defaults,
and portable behavior without hidden magic or fragile assumptions.

## Why it matters

Operational work is full of small but expensive failures: invalid input, inconsistent
logging, brittle naming rules, and fragile automation built on assumptions. IT-ToolBox
was created to reduce those failure points with reusable PowerShell utilities that
prioritize safety, clarity, and portability across modern enterprise environments.

## Why this project exists

This project packages automation patterns that are often built ad hoc in enterprise
workplaces: filesystem validation, identity and DNS checks, log management, secure
string handling, and operational diagnostics. The result is a reusable toolkit that
prioritizes clarity, safety, and portability instead of one-off script logic.

## Portfolio highlights

- Cross-platform PowerShell 7.4+ design
- Secure logging and string-handling helpers with explicit safety boundaries
- Validation-first utilities for email, URLs, DNS, DN and UPN checks
- Operational helpers for timing, script context and filesystem hygiene
- Modernization work that preserves compatibility where it matters
- Built for real deployment scenarios, not just demo scripts

## Use cases

IT-ToolBox is designed for the kinds of tasks that recur in real administrative and
operations work: validating names and input, writing safe logs, enforcing naming rules,
tracing script context, and handling sensitive values without obscuring the logic behind
complex utility wrappers.

Typical scenarios include:

- validating user and endpoint input in scripts before commands run
- adding consistent, redactable logging to automation workflows
- generating secure random values and supporting password workflows
- checking script paths and operational timing in automation tooling
- normalizing filesystem names and reducing operational errors before actions execute

## Project philosophy

The module emphasizes four things: explicit validation, safe defaults, cross-platform
compatibility, and operational clarity. The goal is not to hide behavior behind clever
abstractions, but to provide reliable building blocks that are easy to reason about,
review, and adapt in production automation.

## At a glance

## Project status and roadmap

The module now targets the **3.0.0 release**. The supported API is covered by
cross-platform regression tests. Community testing is welcome, particularly for
the live integrations described below. Review the v2 migration notes before upgrading.

Current roadmap focus:

- preserve the modern PowerShell 7.4+ compatibility baseline
- keep validation behavior explicit and predictable
- improve operational safety and logging semantics
- maintain a clean migration path from legacy patterns
- document integration boundaries and supported dependencies clearly

## Status and requirements

This is **IT-ToolBox 3.0.0**. The modernization review is
complete; live AD, remote CIM and service authentication remain unverified.
Requires PowerShell 7.4 or later (Core edition). Windows
PowerShell 5.1 is not supported.

The module imports without WinSCP, GnuPG, Active Directory or Exchange
dependencies. Most utilities run on Windows, Linux and macOS.
`Test-RegistryValue` is Windows-only; remote `Get-OsUpTime` requires Windows CIM
cmdlets and a reachable Windows endpoint. `Get-ReportChain` requires an available
`Get-ADUser` command and access to AD when invoked. Clipboard output requires a
working platform clipboard backend.

## Quick start from a clone

Clone the repository with Git; no ZIP or build step is required:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SingularVector/IT-ToolBox.git
cd IT-ToolBox
pwsh
```

Then run these commands in PowerShell from the repository root:

```powershell
Import-Module ./IT-ToolBox.psd1 -ErrorAction Stop
Get-Command -Module IT-ToolBox
Get-Help New-LogEntry -Full
Test-IsEmail 'person@example.com'
New-PhoneticPassword -PasswordLength 16 -NoPasswordSpell
```

This imports the local manifest; it does not install the module globally. Import it
again in each new PowerShell session, using an absolute path when running elsewhere.
The master branch contains ongoing development. Record the commit used by
your automation with `git rev-parse HEAD`; updating your clone can change behavior.

To update an existing clone, first commit or otherwise preserve local changes, then:

```bash
git switch master
git pull --ff-only
```

Reload the updated module in PowerShell with
`Import-Module ./IT-ToolBox.psd1 -Force -ErrorAction Stop`.

For compatibility details, see [migration from v2](#migration-from-v2), the command
sections below and [integration ownership](./docs/Integrations.md).
For development, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Command coverage

### Logging, timing and script context

`New-LogEntry`, `New-Timer`, `Get-TimerStatus`, `Stop-Timer`, `Get-ElapsedTime`,
`Get-ScriptDirectory`, `Get-ScriptName`

### Validation and identity

`Test-FileName`, `Test-IsValidPath`, `Test-IsIP`, `Test-IsDate`, `Test-IsEmail`,
`Test-IsUrl`, `Test-IsValidDn`, `Test-IsValidUpn`, `Get-ReportChain`

### Security, conversion and data handling

`New-StringEncryption`, `New-StringDecryption`, `New-RandomString`,
`New-RandomPassword`, `New-PhoneticPassword`, `New-ApiRequest`,
`New-StringConversion`, `Get-StringCheckSum`, `Get-StringHashCode`

### OS, filesystem and operational helpers

`Convert-LogonTimestamp`, `Get-OsUpTime`, `Remove-SpecialCharacters`,
`Test-RegistryValue`

```powershell
Import-Module ./IT-ToolBox.psd1
New-LogEntry -LogMessage 'Started' -LogFilePath './automation.log' -NoConsole
$timer = New-Timer
Get-ElapsedTime -ElapsedTime $timer
Stop-Timer -Timer $timer
```

### Example scenarios

```powershell
# Validate input before use
if (-not (Test-IsEmail 'person@example.com')) {
    throw 'The supplied address is invalid.'
}

# Add secure, redactable logging
New-LogEntry -LogMessage 'Processing request' -LogFilePath './automation.log' -Level WARNING

# Create a phonetic password with explicit composition rules
New-PhoneticPassword -PasswordLength 18 -NoPasswordSpell
```

Logging output only enters the success pipeline when requested with `-PassThru`.
Use `New-LogEntry -GetBuffer`, `-FlushBuffer` and `-ClearBuffer` rather than accessing
module variables. A successful flush removes only the written entries; a failed file write
retains the buffer for retry. Buffer operations are serialized during a flush.
A partially completed filesystem write may still leave content on disk, so retrying after
an I/O failure does not provide an exactly-once delivery guarantee.

Without `-LogFilePath`, logs are created beside the calling script, or in the current
directory for interactive calls. Specify a path to select a stable log filename.
`-RedactionText` is literal text, including dollar signs. Specify only one buffered
severity switch, or use `-BufferOnly -Level WARNING` / `ERROR`.
Redaction is opt-in and does not guarantee detection of every secret.

## Migration from v2

- SCP and GnuPG wrappers and bundled WinSCP binaries are removed. Separate modules
  will own file transfer and OpenPGP; no replacement is bundled here.
- `Legacy/` retains only the historical string encryption/decryption pair for
  migration of existing ciphertext in a separate session.
- All commands formerly retained in `Staging/v3/` now have supported implementations.
  Its README records the migration. Exchange/AzureAD session wrappers and the global
  certificate-validation bypass have been removed; their source remains in Git history.
- Only the twenty-nine listed commands are exported. Private helpers, variables and aliases
  are not exported. Do not treat v3 as a drop-in replacement for every v2 script:
  removed commands and documented parameter, output and encryption changes require
  migration. No restoration of removed service wrappers is promised.
- The module GUID and Git history are preserved.

## Tests and CI

For a clean installable module archive, run `./scripts/Build-Module.ps1` in
PowerShell after running the tests. The archive includes supported module code
and documentation, excluding Legacy, Staging and development files. See
[build and installation instructions](./docs/Packaging.md). Nothing is published
or installed automatically.

```powershell
Install-Module Pester -RequiredVersion 5.7.1 -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-Pester ./Tests
```

CI runs syntax validation, isolated import and Pester on Windows, Linux and macOS
using each hosted runner's installed PowerShell. It does not test every PowerShell
release. Logger tests exercise module import, redaction, failed-write retention,
default paths and simultaneous direct/buffered file writes from three processes.
Temporary HKCU registry tests run on Windows and are skipped on Linux/macOS.
Live AD, remote CIM and service authentication have not been integration-tested.

The logger is adopted from `PowerShell-Functions/New-LogEntry` at commit `d5a9edd`.
The integrated logger includes the maintenance fixes described in CHANGELOG.md.

## Validation semantics

Filename and path checks are lexical checks, not guarantees of existence, permissions
or filesystem limits. Filename rules default to the host platform; use
`-WindowsCompatible` to validate Windows names on another platform. Path checks do
not validate each component as a filename.

`Test-IsIP` retains its historical command name; `Test-IsIpAddress.ps1` is the source
filename. IPv4 shorthand accepted by .NET is deliberately rejected.

`Test-IsDate` defaults to the current culture. For deterministic input, use
`Test-IsDate '2026-10-04' -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd' -Culture ''` (invariant culture).

`Test-IsEmail` validates a practical subset of bare mailbox syntax: ASCII dot-atom
local parts (including plus tags) and DNS domains, including IDNs and single-label
names. Limits are 64 characters for the local part, 63 ASCII characters per domain
label and 254 characters for the address after IDN conversion. It intentionally
rejects display names, comments, quoted or Unicode local parts, address literals,
whitespace and controls. It is not a complete RFC email validator and does not
check mailbox existence, DNS or deliverability. The `Email`, `Mail` and `Address`
parameter aliases remain available.

`Test-IsUrl` accepts absolute HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS URLs with DNS/IDN hosts,
localhost, strict dotted IPv4 or bracketed IPv6, optional numeric ports 0–65535,
paths, queries and fragments. DNS root dots are allowed. It rejects credentials,
relative URLs, other schemes, raw whitespace/controls, backslashes, malformed
percent escapes, empty/invalid ports, IPv4 shorthand and IPv6 scope identifiers.
It checks syntax only, not endpoint reachability or whether fetching a URL is safe.

```powershell
'person+tag@example.com', 'bad' | Test-IsEmail
'https://example.com:8443/api?name=value', '/relative' | Test-IsUrl
```

Both commands return one boolean per pipeline input; explicitly supplied null,
empty or malformed input returns false. Migration from the staged versions:
email validation no longer accepts a display-name/comment wrapper, and the URL
regex is replaced with structured parsing and host checks. FTP and FTPS remain
supported for compatibility; this does not introduce a file-transfer command.

## String encryption

The modern commands retain their names but intentionally change the encryption
format and require an explicit passphrase. They use .NET AES-256-GCM, random
16-byte salt and 12-byte nonce, a 16-byte authentication tag, and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
with 600,000 iterations. Wrong passphrases and changed payloads throw; unauthenticated
plaintext is never returned. The `ITTB1.` prefix identifies this fixed format.

```powershell
# $passphrase must come from your application's secret-handling mechanism.
$encrypted = New-StringEncryption -StringToEncrypt 'example' -EncryptPassPhrase $passphrase
$original = New-StringDecryption -EncryptedString $encrypted -EncryptPassPhrase $passphrase
```

Limits: 1 MiB of plaintext UTF-8 and 4,096 passphrase characters. Encryption
clears temporary plaintext and key byte arrays. Managed strings (including the
passphrase, input plaintext and returned plaintext) cannot be reliably erased;
this API is not a secret vault or password-storage API. Strong passphrases remain
necessary. The functions perform string encryption only, not file encryption or OpenPGP.

### Legacy migration

New ciphertext is incompatible with the historical v2 string encryption format.
There is no automatic fallback. The original functions remain in `Legacy/` solely
for decoding existing data in a separate session. Recover old plaintext with the
original passphrase, salt and vector, then encrypt it using the modern function.
If the old call used computer-name defaults, that original machine name is needed.
Legacy ciphertext lacks authentication, so successful decryption does not establish
its integrity. Do not overwrite existing encrypted data before verifying migration.
Caller-selected `EncryptSalt` and `IntersectingVector` parameters are removed;
new salts/nonces are generated automatically.

Implementation references: [.NET AES-GCM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.aesgcm),
[OWASP cryptographic storage](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)
and [PBKDF2 work-factor guidance](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html).
The PBKDF2 work factor is adopted from OWASP guidance; it is not a security audit
or a guarantee that every deployment meets a compliance standard.

## Password generation

`New-PhoneticPassword` retains its 12-character default, phonetic character table,
category-count parameters, aliases, color/display switches, clipboard option and
string return value. The original symbol exclusions and phonetic spellings are
unchanged. Numeric pipeline inputs accumulate into one returned password, as before.

```powershell
New-PhoneticPassword -LowerCaseLetters 6 -CapitalCaseLetters 4 -NumberDigits 4 -Symbol 4
New-PhoneticPassword -PasswordLength 20 -NoPasswordSpell
New-PhoneticPassword -PasswordToClipboard -NoPasswordSpell
```

Characters are selected using .NET `RandomNumberGenerator.GetInt32`; composition
mode uses a Fisher-Yates shuffle. Clipboard writes use `Set-Clipboard` and honor
`-WhatIf`/`-Confirm`; an available platform clipboard backend is required. An
explicit clipboard failure throws rather than claiming a successful copy. CI mocks
clipboard writes and does not verify a desktop clipboard backend.

`New-RandomString` retains its alphabet and default length 12. `New-RandomPassword`
retains its alphabet and default length 8. Its historical `-Complex` switch remains
accepted with the same behavior; exact category guarantees are provided by
`New-PhoneticPassword`. Defaults are preserved for compatibility, not recommended
as universal password policies.

Lengths must be 1–4,096; composition counts must be nonnegative and total 1–4,096
per pipeline input. Independent secure selection allows repeated characters, fixing
the old random-password length cap caused by sampling without replacement.

## API request helper

`New-ApiRequest` constructs a client request with `client_id`, `grant_type` and
optional `client_secret`, and returns the endpoint response. It is not a general
REST client or an automatic token-acquisition/refresh workflow.

```powershell
$response = New-ApiRequest -ApiKey 'client-id' -ApiSecret $secret -ApiUrl 'https://example.invalid/oauth/token'
$response = New-ApiRequest -ApiKey 'client-id' -ApiSecret $secret -ApiUrl 'https://example.invalid/token' -ContentType 'application/json' -Headers @{ 'X-Request-ID' = 'request-id' }
```

The default is POST with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. JSON content type
serializes the same authentication fields as JSON. `Headers` must be an IDictionary
(e.g. a hashtable); specify Content-Type with `-ContentType`, not inside Headers.
Only form and JSON bodies are supported.

Migration changes: GET no longer defaults, and a GET request cannot include
`ApiSecret`. Secret-free GET remains available and delegates dictionary query
encoding to Invoke-RestMethod. Requests with a client secret or Authorization
header require HTTPS. Other custom headers are not inspected for secrets; callers
should use HTTPS for sensitive requests. Automatic redirects are disabled; use
the final endpoint explicitly. URLs must be absolute HTTP(S) without user-info.

Connection timeout defaults to 30 seconds and can be configured with
`-ConnectionTimeoutSeconds` (alias `-TimeoutSec`). This is not a guaranteed total
wall-clock deadline. Failures terminate with the original Invoke-RestMethod error;
no retries or custom logging are added. Tests mock all HTTP calls: real endpoint
behavior and TLS are not integration-tested.

## String conversion and hashing

`New-StringConversion` retains the original character map, custom-map parameter,
unknown-character replacement and space options. Its default now matches the
documented behavior: spaces become hyphens. It returns exactly one string rather
than leaking collection indices. The map remains domain-specific (for example,
`&` maps to `e`); it is not a general-purpose transliteration or safe-path generator.

Custom maps replace the default map and are copied internally. Space policy
overrides an existing space mapping without mutating the caller's table. Conversion
normalizes text to Form C and handles unsupported Unicode text elements once,
including supplementary characters. This changes output for decomposed accents
and surrogate pairs compared with the old UTF-16 character loop.

`Get-StringCheckSum` retains uppercase hyphen-separated MD5 output by default for
existing non-security comparisons. Select `-Algorithm SHA256`, `SHA384` or `SHA512`
when needed. MD5 is unsuitable for adversarial integrity checks.

`Get-StringHashCode` returns 64 uppercase SHA-256 hexadecimal characters by default.
Use `-LegacyFormat` only when comparing with old delimiter-free decimal output.
The hash algorithm remains SHA-256; the default representation intentionally changes.
Both hash commands use UTF-8 without a BOM and do not normalize text. Neither is
a password-storage function or an authentication mechanism.

## Logon timestamps and OS uptime

`Convert-LogonTimestamp` accepts an unsigned decimal FILETIME string or Int64 value
and supports pipeline input. Local DateTime output remains the default; use `-Utc`
for UTC. `-StringOutput` defaults to `yyyy-MM-dd`, and `-DateFormat` also selects
string output. String formatting uses invariant culture. Invalid values throw.
Zero means no recorded logon and produces no output rather than a date in 1601.
The command converts a supplied value only: AD's replicated `lastLogonTimestamp`
is not an exact record of the user's latest authentication.

```powershell
Convert-LogonTimestamp -TimeStamp $user.lastLogonTimestamp -Utc
Convert-LogonTimestamp -TimeStamp $user.lastLogonTimestamp -Utc -DateFormat 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'
Get-OsUpTime -FullOutput
Get-OsUpTime -ComputerName 'server01' -Credential $credential -FullOutput
```

`Get-OsUpTime` preserves whole elapsed days as Int32 by default and TimeSpan with
`-FullOutput`. Local uptime delegates to PowerShell's built-in `Get-Uptime` on
Windows, Linux and macOS. Remote uptime requires Windows CIM cmdlets and a
reachable Windows CIM endpoint; no remote Linux/macOS support is implied.

Remote queries replace removed `Get-WmiObject` calls with `Get-CimInstance`.
They compute uptime from the server's `LocalDateTime` and `LastBootUpTime`, not
the client's clock. With `-Credential`, a temporary CIM session is created and
cleanup is attempted in `finally`. The historical `-Credentials` switch prompts
with `Get-Credential`; either credential option requires `-ComputerName`. Errors
terminate rather than returning warnings and no value. A failed cleanup is reported
without replacing an already-failed query's error. The caller's error preference
is not changed.

Tests cover actual local uptime and mocked remote query/session behavior. Remote
Windows connectivity and authentication have not been integration-tested.

## Filesystem naming policy and registry values

`Remove-SpecialCharacters` scans descendant files and directories, including hidden
items, and replaces the original punctuation list with a hyphen. Spaces and Unicode
are preserved. Despite its name, it operates on filesystem names, not input strings,
and its policy is not universal filename validation. The root is never renamed.

```powershell
# Preview first; records include Path, NewName, DestinationPath, HasCollision and Status.
Remove-SpecialCharacters -ItemsPath './files'
Remove-SpecialCharacters -ItemsPath './files' -AutoFix -WhatIf
Remove-SpecialCharacters -ItemsPath './files' -AutoFix
```

Preview is the default and creates no files unless logging is requested. AutoFix
preflights existing destinations and duplicate proposed names before any rename,
then processes deepest items first. Collision checks are conservatively insensitive
to case on Windows and macOS, and case-sensitive on Linux. Links and junctions are
not renamed or followed. Literal paths prevent wildcard expansion. Rename errors
terminate; this is not a transaction and an I/O failure can leave earlier renames
completed. Reported paths describe individual operations before ancestor renames.
Avoid changing the tree concurrently with this command.

The historical `-LogActivites` spelling remains supported, with `-LogActivities` as
an alias. An optional `-LogFilePath` overrides the default activity log inside the
root directory. Log paths that participate in the rename plan or lie inside a
directory being renamed are rejected before writes. Only affected-item records
are logged; WhatIf suppresses logging.
This replaces the staged implementation's silent default output, fixed C:\Temp
logging and swallowed errors.

`Test-RegistryValue -Path 'HKCU:\Software\Example' -Value 'Enabled'` is Windows-only.
It checks literal value names, case-insensitively, and returns true for existing
empty strings or zero data. Use `-Value ''` for an unnamed/default value. Missing
keys or values return false; permission failures and other operational errors
terminate. Non-Registry provider paths are rejected. This does not inspect remote
registries or select an alternate registry view.

Filesystem tests use real temporary trees. Windows CI additionally exercises real
temporary HKCU keys; those registry integration tests are skipped on Linux/macOS.

## AD naming and report chains

`Test-IsValidDn` checks a documented practical DN syntax, with escaped separators,
hex escapes, descriptor/OID attribute types and multi-valued RDNs. It accepts
non-DC-rooted names and does not restrict attributes to CN/OU/DC. It rejects empty
names/values, literal controls, invalid/dangling escapes, unescaped leading/trailing
value spaces and legacy quoted values. Hex-string notation is checked without BER
validation; decoded escape bytes are not checked for UTF-8 validity. This is not a
complete RFC parser, a canonical comparison or a schema/existence check.

`Test-IsValidUpn` uses a practical ASCII username policy: letters/digits at the
edges, with dots, underscores, hyphens and apostrophes internally, excluding
consecutive dots. The suffix supports DNS/IDN names, long suffixes and single-label
names. This is not email validation or a complete AD/Entra account-creation policy;
it does not check account existence or whether a suffix is configured.

Both validators preserve their parameter aliases, support pipeline input and
return false for explicit null, empty or unsupported input. These policies replace
the old DN regex and email-derived UPN regex; previously accepted/rejected inputs
can change as described above.

```powershell
Test-IsValidDn -DN 'CN=Last\, First,OU=People,DC=example,DC=com'
Test-IsValidUpn -UPN 'first.last@example.technology'
Get-ReportChain -SAM 'manager01' -DomainController 'dc01' -Properties SamAccountName,Mail
```

`Get-ReportChain` retains SAM, UPN and DN identity parameter sets and aliases,
DomainController, and ordered property selection. Its default properties remain
SamAccountName, UserPrincipalName, Mail, Manager and DirectReports; `-Properties '*'`
requests and projects all properties. It resolves exactly one manager, then uses
AD's matching-rule-in-chain filter to retrieve direct and transitive reports,
excluding the manager itself. Result order is the directory's order.

UPN lookup uses an escaped LDAP equality assertion rather than interpolated
PowerShell filter expressions. Manager DN assertion values are escaped separately
from DN string escaping, including UTF-8 bytes. Server and terminating error
behavior are applied to both queries. Missing/ambiguous managers and AD failures
throw rather than returning a warning and undefined results. The caller's error
preference is not changed.

No ActiveDirectory dependency is required to import IT-ToolBox or use the naming
validators. Get-ReportChain requires an available Get-ADUser command and access to
an AD endpoint when invoked; it uses the command's ambient authentication. Tests
mock AD queries and verify filter construction; no live domain query is tested.

## Script context

Get-ScriptDirectory and Get-ScriptName resolve the immediately calling script rather
than the module implementation file. Calls inside a function defined in a script
use that defining script; a nested or dot-sourced script uses its own path. Calls
made interactively without an explicit path return no output. They do not read the
historical, externally supplied hostinvocation variable.

```powershell
# Inside automation.ps1:
$scriptDirectory = Get-ScriptDirectory
$scriptName = Get-ScriptName
# Explicit paths also work interactively, including paths that do not yet exist:
Get-ScriptDirectory -ScriptPath './scripts/automation.ps1'
'./scripts/automation.ps1', './scripts/other.ps1' | Get-ScriptName
```

ScriptPath accepts literal absolute/relative filesystem filenames and pipeline
input. Relative paths use the current PowerShell location, not the caller's directory.
Wildcard characters are treated literally. Non-filesystem provider paths and paths
without a filename throw; no existence, extension or file-type check is performed.
Unlike the legacy implementations, these helpers do not depend on script-scoped
MyInvocation or silently return a module filename.

## Service integration boundaries

WinSCP/SCP and PGP/OpenPGP are separate module projects. No transfer backend or PGP
backend is bundled into this module; AES-GCM string encryption remains independent.

The AzureAD helper has been removed; use Microsoft Graph or Microsoft Entra PowerShell directly.
The legacy Exchange wrappers have been removed; use ExchangeOnlineManagement
directly for Exchange Online. The process-wide certificate-bypass snippet has been
removed. Import regression tests verify that loading and reloading IT-ToolBox leaves
TLS callbacks, service sessions and caller preferences alone, and excludes archived
and staged code. See [the integration review](./docs/Integrations.md) for defects,
service-specific migration directions and requirements for future wrappers.
