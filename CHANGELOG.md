# IT-ToolBox - Change History

## 3.2.0 - 2026-10-24

- Port Test-IsRegistryKey from PowerShell-Functions, bringing the supported API to 31 commands.
- Share a private registry-key opener with Test-RegistryValue to preserve literal paths, missing-key handling and handle disposal.
- Keep the standalone KeyPath parameter and Boolean contract; reject unsupported platforms and propagate provider/permission errors.
- Update command inventory, release metadata and archive/import expectations; add offline and Windows registry regression tests.

## 3.1.0 - 2026-10-24

- Add Test-IsGuid from PowerShell-Functions as a supported dependency-free validator, bringing the exported API to 30 commands.
- Preserve N/D/B/P format acceptance, zero-GUID acceptance, whitespace rejection and one Boolean per pipeline record.
- Update manifest, loader, README inventory and packaged-module regression expectations for 3.1.0.
- Retain the logger fixes from 3.0.1; no new mandatory module dependencies.

## 3.0.1 - 2026-10-24

- Share logger mutex identities for case-only path aliases on macOS, conservatively serializing distinct case-only names on case-sensitive Mac volumes.
- Reject non-filesystem log destinations before file operations; retain buffered entries after a rejected flush.
- Require an explicit filesystem destination for interactive default-path resolution from a non-filesystem location.
- Correct timeout exception formatting so lock contention reports the intended TimeoutException.
- Add provider-boundary and cross-process lock regression tests. Retain the 29-command API and PowerShell 7.4 baseline.

## 3.0.0 - 2026-10-24

- Deliver the stable 29-command API on PowerShell 7.4+ (Core), with no mandatory external module dependencies at import.
- Retain the module GUID and remove beta prerelease metadata.
- Align Stop-Timer and Get-TimerStatus with the standalone functions: reject null timer arguments during binding, support common parameters and preserve Boolean results for valid calls.
- Simplify Stop-Timer exception handling, remove the unrelated AzureAD diagnostic and preserve elapsed time when stopping.
- Add module-level timer lifecycle, repeated-stop, elapsed-time preservation and caller/module preference regression tests.
- Update manifest attribution to SingularVector while retaining Daniele Catanesi's authorship; describe the module's actual scope.
- Replace repetitive README introductions with a complete 29-command inventory, platform requirements and timer behavior.
- Check that public functions, imported exports, manifest exports and documented commands remain aligned.
- Retain installable archive validation and regression tests on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Migration from v2 includes removed service wrappers, updated string encryption and
changed validation/output contracts; see README.md before upgrading. Live AD,
remote CIM and service authentication were not integration-tested. These are
validation boundaries for this release, not additional bundled features.

## 3.0.0-beta1 - 2026-10-05

The modernization review is complete. This beta retains the 29-command API and
PowerShell 7.4 baseline. Live AD, remote CIM and service authentication still
require integration validation. This entry does not announce a GitHub release
or PowerShell Gallery publication.

### AD helper restoration

- Restore Test-IsValidDn, Test-IsValidUpn and Get-ReportChain; export twenty-seven commands.

- Check Windows registry value names regardless of data; support unnamed values.
- Propagate operational failures and document platform and non-transactional behavior.
- Add real filesystem tests and Windows-only temporary HKCU integration tests.

### Timestamp and uptime restoration

- Restore Convert-LogonTimestamp and Get-OsUpTime; export twenty-two supported commands.
- Preserve local DateTime and default date formatting; add UTC and pipeline conversion.
- Treat zero logon timestamps as no recorded logon; reject invalid FILETIME values.
- Use invariant string formatting and document replicated AD timestamp semantics.
- Preserve uptime days/TimeSpan outputs; support local uptime on Windows, Linux and macOS.
- Replace remote WMI with CIM, use the server clock, support explicit/prompted credentials and clean up sessions.
- Propagate errors without changing caller preferences; document remote Windows requirements.
